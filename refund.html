    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with our editing services. Because our work is digital and creative, our refund policy works as follows:</p>

    <h2>1. Before Work Begins</h2>
    <p>If you cancel within 24 hours of payment and before any editing has started, you’ll receive a full refund.</p>

    <h2>2. After Work Has Started</h2>
    <p>Partial refunds may be granted at our discretion based on the amount of work already completed.</p>

    <h2>3. After Delivery</h2>
    <p>Once final files have been delivered, no refunds are issued. However, we offer free minor revisions within [X days] of delivery.</p>

    <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>Email us at <a href="mailto:[your email address]">[your email address]</a> with your order number and reason for the request. We’ll respond within [X] business days.</p>

    <h2>5. Exceptions</h2>
    <p>Rush fees, add-ons, or third-party costs (like stock footage licensing) are non-refundable.</p>
